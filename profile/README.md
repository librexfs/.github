# Libre XFS

LibreXFS is a community open source project to develop and support open and free eXtensions for Financial Services with priority on Linux support.

The goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient XFS (eXtensions for Financial Services) platform for Linux, utilizing D-Bus as the communication medium. The XFS platform will be designed to facilitate seamless communication between ATM applications and various ATM devices, such as cash dispensers, card readers, receipt printers, and more.

D-Bus, a message bus system that allows communication between different processes or applications within a Linux system, will serve as the communication layer for this XFS platform. It will provide a standardized and reliable means of exchanging messages, commands, and events between the ATM applications and the ATM devices, enabling seamless integration and interoperability.

The project will involve the development of service provider modules (SPMs) that adhere to the XFS standard and implement the necessary functionalities for communicating with different types of ATM devices. These SPMs will be responsible for interfacing with the respective ATM devices and translating requests and responses between the ATM applications and the devices, using D-Bus as the communication medium.

The XFS platform will also include an XFS manager software that will handle the overall coordination and management of the communication between the SPMs and the ATM applications. This manager software will be responsible for routing messages, managing device states, handling errors, and ensuring proper synchronization and flow control between the different components of the XFS platform.

The project will require expertise in XFS standard, Linux system programming, D-Bus communication, and software development using C/C++ or other relevant programming languages. It will involve designing and implementing efficient communication protocols, handling various types of ATM devices, ensuring robust error handling and fault tolerance, and testing the XFS platform extensively for reliability and performance.

Upon successful completion, the XFS platform for Linux with D-Bus communication will provide a solid foundation for building ATM applications on Linux that can seamlessly communicate with different types of ATM devices, offering enhanced flexibility, interoperability, and ease of integration for ATM software developers.
